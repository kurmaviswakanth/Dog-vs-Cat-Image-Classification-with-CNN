# Dog_vs_Cat_Image_Classification_with_CNN

Built a CNN model to classify images of dogs and cats with high accuracy using deep learning techniques.
Utilized the Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, preprocessing images with resizing, normalization, and augmentation (e.g., rotations, flipping) to enhance data quality.
Designed the CNN with multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by fully connected dense layers. Used ReLU for hidden layers and a sigmoid output for binary classification.
Trained the model using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, incorporating validation checkpoints for performance monitoring.
Evaluated performance with accuracy and loss metrics on both training and validation datasets, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize results.
Achieved high classification accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of CNNs in computer vision tasks.

*Technologies*: TensorFlow, Keras, Python, OpenCV, Matplotlib
